/**
 Configures FollowAnalytics SDK. Must be used before any kind of use.
 
 During startup it swizzles, on the UIApplication delegate, a good part of the methods that are
 present in UIApplicationDelegate protocol. If the original delegate was using some dynamic
 unimplemented selector handling to respond to unimplemented merthods this is no longer going to
 work.
 It also does the same thing on the UNUserNotificationCenter delegate if present, otherwise it sets
 it's own delegate. Continues to monitor for delegate changes and if a new one is set it does the
 method swizzling in order to intercept relevant messages.
 All interepted methods are calling the original implementations except some very specific
 FollowAnalytics functions.

 @param configuration FollowAnalyticsImmutableConfiguration
 @param options NSDictionary *options pass launchOptions you get from
 `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`
 @return true is success, false otherwise

 Used to set the current state of user's opt-in/out from analytics collection. By default the user
 is opted-in, if not overriden in the FollowAnalyticsImmutableConfiguration passed to [FollowAnalytics
 startWithConfiguration:startupOptions]. The application can chose to opt-out the user by calling
 [FollowAnalytics setOptInAnalytics:false] at any time.

  The SDK remembers the opt-in state using NSUserDefaults. It is still the responsablity of the
 application to properly set-up the opt-in, according to the choice of the user before sdk
 initialization by passing the appropriate FollowAnalyticsImmutableConfiguration to [FollowAnalytics
 startWithConfiguration:startupOptions].

  When opt-out all already collected analytics are still going to be sent as usual.

  After opt-out the SDK will not collect anymore informations such as:

    - analytics
    - user attributes
    - crash reports

/**
 Requests notification center authorisation to display notifications. This method is going
 to prompt the user for his agreement. The implementations is very close to:
 @code
    if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
        UNAuthorizationOptions options =
          UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge;
        [[UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter]

                        }];
      }else{

      UIUserNotificationSettings* notificationSettings = [UIUserNotificationSettings
        settingsForTypes:UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge |
                         UIUserNotificationTypeSound
              categories:nil];

      [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
     }
 @endcode
 This method is intendend to be used for the basic use case. A sofisticated user should use it's
 own implementation as it seems fit, FollowAnalytics iOS SDK shall adapt without intervention.
 
 When using a custom implementation you can specify the alert types, notification categories etc.
 Then, in order to update what the backend knows about the notification center display permissions,
 you must call:
 @code
 [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
 @endcode
 
 As a courtesy to the user and to increase the efficiency of the opt in, it is recomended to launch
 the authorisation process only in a context that is relevant for the user. It is usualy not a good
 practice to run this method blindly at application startup.

 notifications for apps. This will help users make a more informed decision on whether they want

 notifications will automatically start getting delivered. But these notifications will be delivered
 quietly and will only show up in notifications center, and they will not play a sound.
